# ibex-ruby
Compiler for Ibex written in Ruby.

This compiler (mostly) follows the [specification](https://github.com/ibex-lang/spec). It is not intended as the main compiler for Ibex, but rather a way to start bootstrapping the Ibex compiler in Ibex itself. For this reason, it is not the cleanest of projects.
